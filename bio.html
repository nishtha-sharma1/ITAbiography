			<div class="description">

				<p> 
					I graduated from UNCW in 2011 with a Bachelors in Communication Studies and French.  My professional career has been somewhat of a “zig-zag” line since then. I started out working with non-profits then went on to work for public relations agencies. For the past three years, I’ve focused on digital marking as Content Outreach Specialist on the SEO team at Red Ventures.  
				
					It is through this position, that I started having an interest in coding and as time went on I began to learn more and more about the role.  

					Recently, I was accepted into an Internal Tech Academy at Red Ventures and will get to fulfill my goal of becoming a developer.  This site was created to showcase the learning from the ITA program.  Hope you enjoy.
